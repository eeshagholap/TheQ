## Product Development Information
Product Name: TheQ   
Product Backlog: https://buspark.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/THEQ/boards/14/backlog  

## Sprint Review 1:

#### Backlog Forecast Rationale:  
We wanted to start off by allowing the user to login and get authenticated because we want to keep a track of which student it is and what classes they are taking. After that, we want to allow students to join their respective classes and not have access to all classes that BU has to offer. Once the user is in, we now will start developing the queue. Therefore the next few stories are regarding the development of the queue system which also involves creation and submission of the form that will hold the information for the Instructors. Once we are done with that, we want to focus on the dashboard for the Instructors where they can control and manage the queue and the questions. The last two are extra features that we will try to implement in our MVP provided we have the time. For the next sprint we forecast that we would be able to complete 4 estimated story points therefore we will focus on logging in and authenticating users and work on both frontend and the backend aspect of it.  
**Note: We guarantee that only the Developers have come up with the forecast (Signed: Eesha, Amy, Siddhant, Andrew)**

### Daily Scrum Summary
We had a daily scrum meeting on February 24 where Amy worked on creating 3 stories, Eesha created 3 stories, Andrew created 2 stories and the spring backlog, and Sid worked on 2 stories and collaborated with Alex on the wireframes. Alex worked on the wireframes. In the next 24 hours, Alex plans to make progress on the wireframes and the snapshot, Amy, Eesha, and Sid will start working on the solution interviews and Andrew will start working on the validation. One impediment we see is the lack of responses from our users, mainly professors. Our plan to remove this impediment would be to email a lot of professors to increase the chances of our response rate.
